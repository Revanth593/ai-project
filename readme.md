✅ 1. Existing System – AI Text-to-Speech Converter
In the existing system, users rely on traditional text-to-speech tools that often produce robotic and unnatural voices with limited language support. These systems lack customization such as adjusting tone, speed, and emotion. Many tools also require manual installation or paid software, making them inaccessible for general users.

✅ 2. Existing System – AI Speech-to-Text Transcriber
Current transcription methods are mostly manual or depend on basic speech recognition tools with low accuracy in real-world environments. They struggle with accents, long audio files, background noise, and multi-speaker conversations. Manual transcription is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone.

✅ 3. Existing System – AI Background Noise Remover
Traditional noise reduction tools use simple filters or equalizers that cannot distinguish between speech and noise accurately. They often distort the voice and fail when noise levels are high. Users must manually adjust settings, making the process difficult and inefficient.
